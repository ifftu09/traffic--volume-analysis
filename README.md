# traffic--volume-analysis
ðŸš¦ Bengaluru Traffic Analysis

This project uses TomTomâ€™s Traffic API to collect real-time traffic flow data for Bengaluru. It generates both: â€¢ A Heatmap (to visualize congestion intensity across the city) â€¢ A Graph (to compare congestion levels across grid points)

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ Objectives â€¢ Identify congestion hotspots in Bengaluru during peak hours. â€¢ Build a heatmap of city traffic flow in real time. â€¢ Visualize congestion using both maps and graphs.

set up and installation

clone my repo- git clone --branch airlord-0-patch-1 --single-branch https://github.com/airlord-0/traffic-volume-analysis.git cd traffic-analysis
install dependencies 1.pandas, 2.requests, 3.folium, 4.os, 5.load.env 6.matplotlib 3.create a .env file in your project's root and inside it hide your api key as such : key="your api key"
running the script

python frame.py this will : This will:
Fetch live traffic data from TomTom API.
Generate a heatmap saved as bengaluru_traffic.html.
Show a matplotlib graph comparing congestion levels across grid points.
ðŸ“Š Outputs â€¢ Heatmap: Visualizes congestion (0 = free flow, 1 = heavy congestion). â€¢ Graph: Bar chart comparing congestion indices across grid points.
